# Contributing

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://kcd.im/pull-request)

The priority of this project: `lowest`

If you have questions/suggestions or find bugs/vulnerabilities feel free to open in issue. However, I make no promises as to if/when you'll receive an update. If I kick the bucket, I have no successors to maintain this.

If you think you can fix/improve, feel free to fork and open a PR. I'm more likely to look at a PR. I will happily glance at it and blindly aprove it, because insert IRL reason.

If you need something fixed fast, I very much suggest you fix it yourself, open an issue here, and if you would be so kind, submit the PR.

I do this mostly for fun, but sometimes professionally. Treat me like you would your favorite fanfiction author. I will happily ignore your flames.
