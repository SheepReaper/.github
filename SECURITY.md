# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Most of the code I provide is born out of either self convenience or passionate pet projects. That said, this is a one-man operation. I'm not M$, and will not support anything besides the latest version. This policy applies to all of my projects.

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
|  latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < latest | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Open an issue on this repo, linking any relevant materials, and most desiredly, a PR with a proposed fix. If you don't have a PR, that's OK, but don't expect haste on my part.

If something is particularly sensitive, please feel free to contact bgonza868+ghsecurity@gmail.com
